Your minefields won't hit neutrals

Minefields are always evenly-distributed density throughout the system, so sweeping reduces density

Penetrating scanning of a system shows all the minefields in it (owner, density)

Density=
mines are laid in mines per year; compute volume of system and  
=number of times you roll did-you-hit-a-mine per terameter (10/90? 50/50?) 
proportional to kT of ship?  % chance of hit=kT/10 or kT/100?
(implement in ship, combat & in-system movement will call it)
laying? integer per 1/100 of a year
decay?
sweeping?
damage per mine?

Heavy Cruiser 500kT w/ 500 armor moving 1tm (1pt per mine) max density =hits 400 mines; gravimetric cross-section=mass x 50 
moves 0.5tm during a battle
 
volume of system 4.2x10^27 km3 if 6.4x10^10 per mine then 6.5x10^16 mines for dense coverage?
if laying with 12 components for 25 years = 300 x component's output

SD 2000kT moving 1tm; in a dense minefield
