    "description": "Deploys a minefield for defending a star system.  This minelayer deploys up to 7.5 billion mines per year.  That sounds like a lot, but for defending an entire solar system, it's not.  A Depot component is large equipment which unfolds or deploys outside the ship and can only be used when the ship is stopped.",
