    "description": "The second-lowest-tech scanner.  It detects ships at a distance based on their kinetic energy (mass times speed squared). It is affected by cloaking. This scanner can detect a 100kT ship traveling hyper 6 at 75 light years, a 100kT ship traveling hyper 10 at 225 light years, and a 10kT ship traveling hyper 6 at 25 light years. It cannot see stopped ships or inside solar systems.",
